As you are aware the frequency of update training for a trained Sample Taker is every 3 years, however, according to our records your training has expired or there is no record of update training completed.    
 
We need you to confirm and provide evidence that your update training is completed.  If it has not, can you complete your update training by clicking on the link below to access an accredited e-learning site?  Also if your HPV training is not completed the link is also available.

ham,"This email has been sent to all SSTS users. 

SSTS authorisation deadline 
The SSTS authorisation deadline is the end of the day on Wednesday 7th October. Your cooperation in ensuring that all data is entered into SSTS and authorisations are complete by the 7th is required and very much appreciated. 


Public Holidays 
Due to the number of areas that have been working the public holidays, rosters set up as ""NoPH"" were changed behind the scenes in the SSTS system for the April, May and July public holidays and this will happen again for the September public holiday. 

There is no change to how having the public holiday day or working the public holiday should be entered in SSTS or HealthRoster. 

If an employee was taking the public holiday then record it as PH leave absence and the shift they would have worked. If the PH leave absence is not entered it will generate an incorrect salary payment. 

If an employee was working the public holiday then record the shift they worked; do not enter a PH leave absence. For those who worked the public holiday, unsocial hour enhancements will be automatically paid, regardless if your SSTS/HealthRoster roster is headed up as ""NoPH"" or not. The correct SSTS/HealthRoster entry must be input as noted above. 


Helpdesk 
Interim contact arrangements are currently in place for the Central Rostering Team. Email communication is strongly encouraged and is therefore the preferred option.
